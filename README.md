My solution was to extract the ProductCard as a separate component.

In this case, we get a reusable component that we can use not only on the main page but also on the product page to display a showcase of similar products. 

Furthermore, in every place where we use this element, we can wrap it in a div, to which we can assign custom classes specific to that location.
